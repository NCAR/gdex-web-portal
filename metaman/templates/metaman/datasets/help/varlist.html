<h3>Detailed Variables</h3>
<p>
    You can specify detailed variable names and their units, and you can point to a document that contains a list of detailed variables.
</p>
<p>
    If you include a list of detailed variables, it will be indexed for the dataset search.  Enter one variable name per line.  You can optionally also specify the units for the variable on the same line.  The units must be separated from the variable name with the "::" (double colon) string.  Whitespace is allowed in the variable names and units and will not be used as a separator.
</p>
<p>
    There is no standard format for the units, but if you use the "^" (carat) to indicate an exponent, it can be transformed for a nicer appearance in HTML.  Example - specify the units as <b>m s^-1</b> and it can be made to look like <b>m s<sup>-1</sup></b> on a web page.
</p>
<p>
    To point to a document containing detailed variable information, enter the full URL on one line, beginning with "http:", "https:", or "ftp:".  If you enter more than one URL, only the first one will be accepted.  The information in the document you point to can be in any format you choose.  It will <b>not</b> be indexed for the dataset search.  Therefore, this is a sub-optimal way to specify detailed variables.
